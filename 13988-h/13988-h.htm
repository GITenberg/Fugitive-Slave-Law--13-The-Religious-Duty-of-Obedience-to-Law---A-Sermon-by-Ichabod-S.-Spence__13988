<h2>SERMON.</h2>


<div class='blkquot'><p>Titus, III. 1. Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers
to obey magistrates, to be ready for every good work.</p>

<p>Ro. xiii. 1-7. Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For
there is no power but of God, the powers that be, are ordained of God. Whosoever,
therefore, resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God, and
they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation: (harm, loss, or ruin).
For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then
not be afraid of the power? do that which is good and thou shalt have praise
of the same: for he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do
that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is
the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.
Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience'
sake. For, for this cause pay ye tribute also, for they are God's
ministers, attending continually upon this very thing. Render therefore to
all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear
to whom fear; honor to whom honor.</p></div>
<br />

<p>There are two great classes of human duty. One of
them embraces duties which we owe to God, the other embraces
duties which we owe to men.</p>

<p>This classification of duties received the sanction of Jesus
Christ, when he spake of <i>loving the Lord our God with all
our heart</i>, as the spirit and sum of the one class of duties,
and of <i>loving our neighbor as ourselves</i>, as the spirit and
sum of the other class of duties. It had also been previously
taught at Mount Sinai, when God gave to Moses the two
tables of the law&mdash;the one enjoining our duty to God, the
other enjoining our duty to man.</p>

<p>This classification of duties is not arbitrary. It is founded
on truth and nature. Men have relations to God, as their
Creator, Upholder, Governor, Redeemer, and rightful Judge;
and they are bound to recognize these relations, and feel
and act accordingly. Men hold relations to one another,
as parents, children, citizens, rulers, and subjects; and they
are bound to recognize these relations, and feel and act accordingly.
Such is the will of God. Such is the law of
God. There can be no holiness in man aside from conformity
to the will of God in this thing.</p>

<p>This principle is carried out in all the teachings of the
New Testament, with an emphasis and a plainness which no
candid and unprejudiced mind can fail to understand. Jesus
Christ has incorporated it into his sermon on the mount
in many particulars, wherein he insists upon our social
duties, while he teaches religion. He preached this principle
when he said, &quot;render unto Caesar the things that are
Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's.&quot; He
practised on this principle when he made the fish bring in
his mouth the tribute-money which, as a citizen, he owed to
the government of the country,&mdash;a government a thousandfold
more oppressive than ours.</p>

<p>It would be a fundamental error, if we were to maintain,
that <i>religion</i> has nothing to do with the regulation of our
conduct towards one another,&mdash;as parents, as children, as
magistrates, subjects and citizens; but that it has left all
that field of duty to be regulated by the individual preferences
of men. It has not done so. Social duties come as
really within the field of <i>religious</i> obligation, as any other
duties. &quot;The fifth commandment requireth the preserving
the honor and performing the duties belonging to every one
in their several places and relations, as superiors, inferiors,
and equals.&quot; As men, in any relationship we hold, neighbors,
citizens of the state, children, parents, or any other
earthly connection, religion extends its authority over us;
and our conduct in each one of these relationships constitutes
a part of our holiness or our sin.</p>

<p>God has not seen fit to enact special or particular laws
for us, to regulate our conduct in all respects, as here associated
with one another, and owing duties to one another,
as neighbors, citizens of the commonwealth, husbands,
wives, and children. He has himself enacted only <i>general</i>
laws for us,&mdash;laid down great general principles, under the
authority and light of which, he has left men to regulate the
particulars as they please, by the governments which they
establish.&mdash;only not contravening his great general principles
and laws.</p>

<p>He has himself made <i>all</i> the laws which are needful, and
all which can be justly obligatory upon us in respect to
<i>divine worship</i>,&mdash;such duties as praise, prayer, preaching
the gospel, and observing the sacramental ordinances;&mdash;and
no human authority may either repeal these laws or add to
them. But in respect to the duties which we owe to our
neighbor, that is, to our fellow-man, in any relation he holds
to us or can ever hold; God has left the most of these duties
to the authoritative decision of human governments. He
has thus made a difference betwixt these two classes of
duties. The reason for this difference seems to be this;
namely, man's wisdom can reach farther in ascertaining
what is fit or right betwixt him and his fellow-man, than in
ascertaining what is fit or right betwixt him and his God:
and consequently, man can legislate in respect to property,
and other matters of human right, but not in respect to
prayer, and other matters of the first class of duties. Moreover,
in respect to worship, God is himself one of the parties.
The parties are not man and man, as they are in all social
duties; but they are man and God:&mdash;and therefore, it would
seem but fit and natural, that God should legislate <i>exclusively</i>
in respect to the duties which we owe to <i>Him</i>, and more
specifically, than in respect to the duties which we owe to
one another. Hence, we find it so. Explicit divine law
regulates all the <i>particulars</i> of the one class of duties; the
<i>particulars</i> of the other class of duties are left to human law,
or the regulations of human society.</p>

<p>But this latter class of duties, that is, our social duties,
are <i>not left</i> to the <i>individual</i> judgment or independent
choice of men, in such a sense, that they may obey or disobey
human government just as they please. Not in the
least. Human government is by the divine will. Obedience
to it is obligatory upon men, by the will and law of
God. St. Paul directing Titus how to preach, (and therefore
directing all ministers of the gospel who come after him,)
says to him, &quot;Put them in mind to be subject to principalities
and powers, to obey magistrates:&quot; and I am doing it
in this sermon. Human government is of divine authority,
not the <i>kind</i>, but the fact. And consequently, our action
about human government, our obedience to it, and our disobedience,
are as much matters of religion, and coming
under its authority and obligation, as are any other matters.
If religion had nothing to do with them, I would have nothing
to do with them here. But it <i>has</i> something to do
with them. Human government is a divine ordinance. It
is of divine authority. It is <i>not</i> a thing of mere human
authority. Our <i>religion</i>, therefore, our holiness and final
salvation are concerned in our sentiments, principles, and
conduct in reference to human government. If God <i>has</i>
left to men the choice of the <i>kind</i> of government they will
have, he has <i>not</i> left it to their choice whether they will
<i>obey</i> human government or not. He has commanded that
obedience. Human government and law are by the will of
God. This is a religious principle. And almost the entire
sum of our second class of duties, by the will of God, lies
under the regulation of human government. God has himself
legislated in respect to the other class of duties. Human
government is founded on the revealed will of God.</p>

<p>The different expressions contained in the texts which we
have just read in your hearing, place this principle beyond
all controversy. Glance at them again. &quot;Put them in
mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey
magistrates.&quot; (I am doing so&mdash;I am preaching gospel this
morning.) &quot;Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers.
For there is no power but <i>of God</i>. The powers that be,
are ordained <i>of God</i>. Whosoever, therefore, resisteth the
power, resisteth the ordinance <i>of God</i>. Rulers are not a
terror to good works, but to the evil. Do that which is
good, and thou shalt have praise of the same, for he is a
minister <i>of God</i> to thee for good.&quot; We are commanded to
be &quot;subject for conscience' sake.&quot; Magistrates &quot;are God's
ministers.&quot;&mdash;What could be plainer?&mdash;This is <i>religion</i>: not
politics, but religion. Human government is &quot;ordained of
God.&quot; Magistrates are &quot;ministers of God,&quot; to whom men
are commanded to be &quot;subject for conscience' sake.&quot;</p>

<p>This, therefore, settles the principle, on which obedience
to human government is the religious duty of men. There
may be a point where that obedience may justly stop, (a
matter which we shall consider soon;) but the great principle
before us now is an important one, namely, that human
government and Law are things which exist by the will of
God, and men are bound to submit to them on that high
ground. This is the general rule. This is a <i>religious</i> duty;
whatever exceptions we may be able to find sometimes,
among the diversities of human Law and human condition
under it,&mdash;or when human Law would interfere with the
first class of our duties, which God does not allow it to do.
&quot;The powers that be, are ordained of God.&quot;</p>

<p>Let it, therefore, be carefully noticed, that no man or
body of men has any right to say, that they will be without
government, without Law, or that religion has nothing
to do with the question of their civil obedience to Law.
Such obedience must <i>be a part</i> of their religion, or they cannot
be Christians. It is a part of the <i>will and ordinance</i> of
God.</p>

<p>Among politicians and statesmen, the idea of what they
call &quot;the social compact&quot; is a very familiar idea, and sometimes
figures largely. They mean by this, that there exists
between the different members of every civilized and orderly
community, a tacit &quot;compact&quot; or agreement, by which
each individual tacitly or impliedly consents to surrender
some of his natural rights into the hands of the community
in general, or the hands of its government, in order to have
the power of the community in general, or power of its government
protect him in the enjoyment of others of his
rights. Thus, they tell us, that each man receives a benefit
from the power of society or government, which he could
not secure by his individual power, and receives it in return
for the individual natural rights, which he surrenders to the
general society or government: so that, on the whole, this
&quot;compact&quot; between him and the body politic is beneficial
to him. For example, he might not be able to defend his
farm from the violence of unjust men, who might deprive
him of it; and so he procures the aid of civil government
to defend it for him, and in return for this benefit he consents
that his farm shall be taxed, and consents also to forego
his personal right to defend it himself in any manner he
could, and let the government defend it for him in their own
way. So of all other civil provisions, rights and duties
under the civil government. Politicians are accustomed to
refer them all to &quot;the social compact.&quot;</p>

<p>I do not complain of this idea of a &quot;social compact,&quot;
when the idea is presented merely as a justification of government,
or as an <i>explanation</i> of the propriety, necessity
and equity of Law. But when it is presented as <i>the foundation</i>
on which civil government reposes, though it may
satisfy a citizen, it ought not at all to satisfy a Christian.
The truth is, there is no such &quot;social compact.&quot; The idea
is only a fancy. Human government is not founded on
any such &quot;social compact&quot; at all. It either exists by force,
or it is founded on the will of God, in every case. Its <i>just</i>
foundation is the will of God. And when men are submitting
to human government, they are not to consider themselves
as merely carrying out the implied conditions of a
&quot;social compact;&quot; but their duty is, to consider themselves
as submitting to an <i>ordinance</i> of their God and Maker.
Human government is of a more high and sacred and
solemn character, than the mere idea of a &quot;social compact&quot;
would make it. God has something to do with it&mdash;much
to do with it. His will is the solid foundation on which it
rests, (even though at first it may have been established by
force,) and every man is religiously bound to regulate his
obedience or disobedience to human government on this
divinely revealed principle. &quot;The social compact&quot; may be
a very good idea to employ for convincing an infidel in respect
to the right of Law; but it is too low and loose an
idea for a Christian; it falls far below the truth, and below
the just solemnity of obligation.</p>

<p>The <i>necessity</i> of human Law results very much, if not
entirely, from the injustice of mankind. In no age since
the fall of Adam, has any considerable body of men been
found so just and upright, that civil Law could be dispensed
with. The bad would do injustice to the good, if it
were not for Law, and those magistrates appointed by Law,
who are &quot;a terror to evil doers.&quot; Conscience is not effective
in the breast of every sinner, and therefore Law must
come in, to hinder that injustice, which, without it, would
not be hindered by individual conscience, and to compel
that righteousness which, without it, individual conscience
would fail to enforce. As individual conscience becomes
more stringent, civil Law may become more lax. If men
would be just towards one another of themselves, there
would be no necessity of human Law, to compel them to
abstain from injury and to perform their duties to one
another.</p>

<p>Consequently, Law is a friend to the human race. It is
the protector of the good man; and it punishes the bad
man, only for the purpose of securing rights,&mdash;property,
liberty and life. And even the bad would be worse off a
thousand fold than they are, if there were no efficient Law
to restrain them by its authority and sanctions.</p>

<p>The <i>importance</i> of civil Law is vastly great. Its importance
can scarcely be exaggerated by any representation.
The most of our earthly happiness lies under the protection
of human Law, and lies there by the will of God. We
have not an item of property, in land, or houses, or goods,
or chattels, or money, which the Law does not guard for
us; and we have very little indeed, which we could effectually
guard for ourselves. If this protecting, guarding Law
is not enforced,&mdash;if the Law is obstructed, or crippled, or
baffled, or violently set at naught; then, the security of
civilized society is gone, and our property, our liberty, our
rights, privileges and life, just lie at the mercy of every unjust
man, and any violent and excited band of the wicked!&mdash;So
important to us is the potential dominion and regular
administration of Law.</p>

<p>Moreover our very rights in religion, our privilege to
have the word of God and read it, to worship God according
to the dictates of our own conscience, to preach the
gospel and hear it, are rights and privileges, which, in this
unjust world, we could not enjoy for a single year, aside
from the protection and potential administration of human
government.</p>

<p>If this human government, the government of Law, cannot
be maintained, therefore, there is nothing on earth valuable
to us, which is secure for a single hour! If the Law
cannot be enforced, then government is at an end and anarchy
reigns, and all is confusion, uncertainty, and violence!
Order, civilization, Christianity is not safe!</p>

<p>There is indeed a <i>limit</i> to the obedience due to human
government. Such government may become, and sometimes
does become, so unjust, oppressive, tyrannical, and
cruel, as not to answer the designed, and righteous, and
beneficial purposes of government for a whole people; and
in such a case, it deserves no respect as an ordinance of
God, for it is then acting contrary to the will of God and
the necessity of society; and the injured and oppressed
people may justly rise in rebellion against such a government,
and overthrow it, if they can. But, let it be carefully
remembered, that any violent resistance is positive rebellion
against the government; and either that resistance must be
crushed, or the government must be overturned. There is
no middle way&mdash;there can be none. In such a case the
whole authority and power of the government come into
direct hostility and conflict with the violence which resists
the execution of Law; and government must crush that violence,
or that violence must crush the government. A government
is at an end, a nullity, when it cannot execute its
laws. Let it be carefully remembered also, that violent resistance
to Law cannot be justified, when there is no righteous
design to overthrow the government itself; for no man
owes a <i>half</i>-allegiance to government, or can commit a
<i>half</i>-high-treason; and besides, Law is too important and
delicate a thing to have its majesty trifled with, by the wicked
nonsense of a <i>half</i>-obedience. Let it be carefully remembered
also, that violent resistance to Law cannot be
justified, when there is no fair prospect of overthrowing the
government, and being able to establish a better one. To
justify violent resistance to the laws, it is not enough that
the government is unjust and its laws unrighteous; it is
necessary also, that there should be no good ground to hope
for a cessation of that unrighteousness in some peaceful
way, and that there should be a prospect of some good to be
gained by the resistance, which good shall be worth more
than all the labor, and treasure, and strife, and blood, which
the revolution shall cost. Let it be carefully remembered,
too, that violent resistance on any one point is rebellion on
every point, for &quot;he that offendeth in one point is guilty of
all:&quot; such resistance is opposition by force to one entire
government&mdash;is just a conflict with the powers that be; so
that any resisting individual or number of individuals who
commence a violent resistance on any one point, have cast
off their allegiance to the entire government, and stand in
the attitude of open and hostile rebellion.</p>

<p>It may not be an easy thing to settle the right of rebellion&mdash;to
determine the question, when a people have a right
forcibly to resist the execution of regularly enacted Law.
But we <i>can</i> tell <i>something</i> about it. There are some things
perfectly clear on this point.</p>

<p>1. To justify rebellion, (or what is the same thing, forcible
resistance of the laws,) a government must be so bad, as
to fail manifestly of its just end, that is, to promote the
happiness of the people. If it does promote that general
happiness, it answers the just end of government&mdash;it is a
good government, and ought not to be overthrown.</p>

<p>2. To justify rebellion, the injustice or failure of a government
must be so great, that it cannot be endured,&mdash;so
great, that it will manifestly be better on the whole, to run
all the risks of a bloody conflict, of civil war, than to endure
the execution of the governmental laws.</p>

<p>3. To justify rebellion, there must be little or no prospect
that the government can be peaceably altered, as ours may
be, or that the injustice or oppression of the government
can be made to cease by any peaceable means. Violence
against government, rebellion, civil war, are no small matters.
They bring horrid evils along with them. The injury
of government must be very great to justify the introduction
of such evils; and if the injury can be made to cease,
by any peaceable means and within any reasonable time, it
would be better to bear the injury for a while, than to involve
the nation in confusion and blood, with uncertainty as
to <i>the result</i>.&mdash;The last four years' experience of nations in
Europe may read us a lesson.</p>

<p>A republic is different from a despotism. A nation where
a Constitution forming the foundation of Law, limiting its
enactments and establishing courts, is plainly written out in
language that everybody can understand,&mdash;where Constitution
and Law provide for their own amendment at the will of
the sovereign people expressed in a regular and solemn
manner,&mdash;where the will of the people thus governs, and
(for example,) there is no &quot;taxation without representation,&quot;&mdash;where
the elective franchise is free, and every man capable
of intelligently exercising the right may give his voice
for altering the Constitution or Law,&mdash;and where, therefore,
there can be no necessity of violently opposing the laws, and
no excuse for meanly evading them;&mdash;<i>such</i> a nation is very
differently conditioned from what it would be, if the will of
one man or of a few governed. In such a nation, rebellion,
or any evasion of Law, becomes a more serious moral evil.
Rebellion <i>there</i> can scarcely be called for; and it were difficult
to gauge the dimensions of its unrighteousness!</p>

<p>4. To justify rebellion, it is necessary that there should be
a fair prospect of successful resistance&mdash;of an overthrow of
the government. If the resistance is not likely to be successful
for good, but is only likely to cost the lives of the
resisting individuals and others; then, such individuals are
sacrificing themselves and others for no good purpose,&mdash;which
is a thing that cannot be justified to reason or religion.
A man has no right to fling away his life for a mere sentiment,
and leave his wife a widow, or his gray-haired parents
without a son to solace them. There must be some fair
prospect of great good to come from it, before one can justly
fling his life into the scale, in a violent contest with the
government.</p>

<p>5. To justify rebellion, there must be a fair prospect of the
firm <i>establishment of a letter government</i>, and the enactment
of more just laws, after the present government is
overturned. Nothing can justify a revolution, a conflict, a
waste of treasure and blood, which are not going <i>to gain
anything</i> in the end.&mdash;Again, the last four years' experience
of European nations may read us a lesson.</p>

<p>6. To justify rebellion, or what is the same thing, violent
resistance to the execution of the laws, it is necessary that
something more than a <i>small fraction</i> of the people should
rise in such a resistance. If the people in general are ready
for it, and are willing to run all the hazards of a rebellious
conflict with the government, conscious that they have
righteousness and the God of righteousness on their side;
this is a very different affair from what it would be, if only
a minority of the people were ready for rebellion. Such a
minority have no right, on account of their deemed injuries,
to plunge the nation into a civil war, for the purpose of over-turning
a government which suits the great mass of the
people;&mdash;a civil war, in which there is every prospect, that
the government and the majority who aim to support it will
prevail; and prevailing, must crush their hostile opponents,
this hasty and reckless minority.</p>

<p>These are some of the things which appear necessary, in
order to justify violent resistance of Law. They must <i>all</i>
exist, or such resistance would be criminal,&mdash;contrary to
reason, to benevolence, and to Christ.</p>

<p>It is not a thing to be expected at all among mankind,
that all laws should be right, or &quot;just and equal.&quot; Human
legislation must be expected to bear the marks of an imperfection,
which attaches itself to everything human. If obedience
to government were obligatory, only on the condition
that all the laws of that government are just; then, such
obedience would mean nothing at all, and every man would
be absolved from all allegiance to the government, and
from all obligations to obey. Such is man, so limited his
wisdom and so imperfect his holiness, that human laws must
necessarily be imperfect, and must, therefore, necessarily
operate hardly in some instances, upon more or less of the
people. It is impossible, that the thing should be otherwise&mdash;in
the very nature of the case, it is impossible. And if
every individual were allowed to be the judge in his own
case, whether or not the law operated so hardly upon him
that he might disobey; <i>then</i> his <i>obligation</i> to obedience
would mean just nothing at all, and Law would be nothing
more to him than mere advice. It might be very good advice,
but he might spurn it, if he chose. <i>I</i> may think it
hard and unjust upon myself, that, in the great &quot;Empire
State,&quot; by a sort of &quot;bill of attainder,&quot; (I know not what
else to call it,&mdash;I suppose I must not call it a <i>slave law</i>,) I am
prohibited from holding any &quot;office of profit or trust,&quot; because
I <i>will preach</i> the gospel, and people will hear me;&mdash;but
notwithstanding this law, (which you will not allow me
to call by any hard name,) you think me under obligation
to obey the government,&mdash;and I think so too. I shall not
rebel.</p>

<p>The <i>execution</i> of the Law also, must necessarily be imperfect,
for the same great reason&mdash;human imperfection: judges
and jurors are not infallible. But, what then? <i>God
knew all this</i> when he ordained human government, and
commanded us to be subject to it. Such government, with
all its unavoidable imperfection and errors, on the whole is
beneficial&mdash;indispensable&mdash;we could not do without it.&mdash;And
rarely, very rarely indeed, is there a single instance of
an individual man, here or beyond the Potomac, whom
Law has injured <i>more</i> than it has benefited. Even if that
Law unjustly takes away his liberty or his life, it may have
done him more good than injury; his liberty or his life
might have been sooner and more cruelly destroyed without
it. It would be hard to prove the contrary, in any one case
that ever existed or ever will, here or elsewhere.</p>

<p>The best and wisest Laws ever enacted by man, or that
ever will be enacted by man, may sometimes operate hardly,
even destructively, upon some particular persons. An
innocent man may be accused of murder, tried, convicted,
and sentenced to ignominious execution. But, <i>what then</i>?
May this man, who <i>knows</i> his innocence, justly arm himself
with deadly weapons, and kill the officer who would execute
the sentence of the Law upon him,&mdash;and thus get out
of his hands? May this innocent man's neighbors, who
know his innocence as well as he, &quot;<i>lawfully interpose their
own persons</i>&quot; betwixt him and the officer of Law, and thus
rescue him?&mdash;and may they do this, because they have
decided for themselves, that this is not a case &quot;<i>where the
administration of justice is concerned</i>?&quot; If so, then all
Law and Government must soon come to an end, and anarchy,
mobs and confusion reign! If so, then each man
becomes really his own Lawmaker, and when <i>he thinks</i> the
Law unjust towards him, may resist it unto blood! If one
man is at liberty to &quot;<i>be fully prepared for</i> his own defense,&quot;
and calling the legal officer an &quot;assailant,&quot; or an
&quot;assassin,&quot; may resist the execution of one law which he
deems hard upon him, then another man may do the same
thing in reference to another law; and the consequence
inevitably must be, that all Government, Law and security
are at end! If my neighbor may arm <i>himself</i>, and kill a
legal officer who attempts the discharge of his sworn duty;
then I may arm <i>myself</i> also, when I deem the Law unjust
to me, and kill another legal officer, who attempts to execute
the Law! And if all this may be, LAW is nothing
but a bugbear or a bubble&mdash;is a dead letter&mdash;and the texts
of God's word which we have just read to you may be disobeyed,
and ought to be blotted from the Bible!</p>

<p>My brethren, this is a very solemn subject! No theme
of earth could be more so. All our earthly benefits, and
no small part of our spiritual privileges and hopes are
wrapped up in it. Religion <i>cannot</i> prosper, if Law is not
potential&mdash;if the minds of the people are to be perpetually
agitated, distracted and tormented, by confusion, fear and
uncertainty!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I have stated these great principles, and made these general
remarks upon the subject presented in our texts, on account
of some recent teachings which have been put forth as
<i>religious</i>&mdash;put forth in <i>religious</i> publications, by <i>ministers</i>
of the gospel. I have no reference to mere politics&mdash;to
political papers or political parties, whig or democrat. I
have never entered into such matters: other things occupy
me. I have never given but one vote in any legal election,
during the eighteen years I have resided in the State since
I returned to it; and I never expect to give another. And
if principles opposite to those I have laid down in this sermon
were promulgated among us, only by politicians and
political parties and papers, I should not advert to them
here. I have always supposed, that some extravagant and
evil principles would be occasionally promulgated for party
purposes and political effect, and that the people very well
understand this, and therefore will not be led very far astray
by them. And whenever such evil principles have been
put forth in the name of religion, by men whose fanatical
phrensy contemned the Sabbath and other institutions of
God, (like some of our Northern fanatics, &quot;men of one idea&quot;
and not capable of two,) I have very seldom adverted to
them at all, but have supposed it best to leave them to be
counteracted by their own extravagance and by the character
of their advocates, and let them die by their own contemptibility.
But now, principles, contrary to the plain
meaning of the texts before us, come to our ears from some
more respectable quarters, and in the name of religion. I
should be a traitor to the high trust of this pulpit, if I did
not caution you against them. Forbearance and delicacy
must sometimes have limits. We owe duties to truth and
Christianity, which tenderness must not make us violate.</p>

<p>The &quot;New York Evangelical Congregational Association&quot;
recently passed the following Resolution in respect to
the &quot;Fugitive-Slave Law,&quot;&mdash;a Law regularly enacted by
the Congress of the United States:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Resolved, That we cannot recognize this Law, as of any
binding force upon the citizens of our country.&quot;&mdash;(I am
thankful that these modest men did not go on, like him of
the triple crown, to absolve &quot;the citizens of our country&quot;
from all allegiance to the government, and give our rulers
over into the hands of a majesty fit to take care of them.)</p>

<p>A <i>religious</i> paper, edited by Congregational clergymen,
holding respectable stations, Pastors of churches,&mdash;a paper
professedly devoted to the cause of Christ,&mdash;holds the following
language in an <i>Editorial</i> article, under the caption,
&quot;How to oppose the Fugitive-Slave Law&quot;:&mdash;</p>

<p>This <i>religious</i> paper says,&mdash;&quot;To the fugitives themselves ...
this Law is no Law ... and to resist it even unto
death, is their right, and it may be their duty.... To
each <i>individual</i> fugitive, to every man or woman, who
having escaped from bondage and tasted liberty, is in hourly
peril of being seized and dragged back to slavery, we
say,&mdash;Be fully prepared for your own defense. If to you
death seems better than slavery, then refuse not to die&mdash;whether
on the way-side, at your own threshold, or even as
a felon upon the gallows. Defend your liberty and the
liberty of your wife and children, as you would defend your
life and theirs against the assassin. If you die thus, you
die nobly, and your blood shall be the redemption of your
race. Should you destroy the life of your assailant, you will
pass into the custody of the criminal Law ... under
an indictment for murder; but the verdict of the community,
and the verdict of almost any jury will be, justifiable
homicide in self-defense.... Or should a different verdict
be found, and you be condemned to die as a murderer,
your ignominious death shall be luminous with the halo of
a martyr, and your sacrifice shall be for the deliverance of
your people.&quot;</p>

<p>Such are the <i>religious</i> principles, and such is the <i>religious</i>
advice of these <i>religious</i> ministers!</p>

<p>I am sorry to see this. <i>I never read more wicked and
abominable principles!</i> They deserve not only the reprehension
of every Christian, but the entire indignation of <i>all
civilized mankind</i>! They advise private arming with
bloody weapons&mdash;they advise violent resistance and murder&mdash;the
murder of officers of civil Law engaged in the discharge
of the duty which they have sworn to perform! I
have no words to express my abhorrence of these wicked
and outrageous sentiments, so directly contrary to the whole
nature of all civilized society, to the precepts of the Bible,
and the whole spirit of Christianity! I speak not of the
<i>men</i>. Good men may err. But these principles, which
these ministers have published as religious ones, are horribly
and outrageously wicked!</p>

<p>There are other things in this religious paper, which we
think are calculated to do immense mischief. This editorial
article &quot;would utter its remonstrance against all violent resistance
to the execution of the Law.&quot; Indeed! Very
quiet and peaceful, after having talked about being &quot;fully
prepared for defense&quot;&mdash;about death &quot;on the wayside, at
the threshold and on the gallows&quot;&mdash;about &quot;murder,&quot; and
about &quot;martyrdom.&quot; Away with such morality! aiming
at one thing and professing another!&mdash;&quot;If one sees a fellow
man struggling with his captors,... he may lawfully
interpose his own person between the parties and separate
them.&quot; Away with such morality! encouraging people to
&quot;act a lie,&quot; by opposing Law while professing to obey it!
And this species of morality is virtually commended to the
jury-box; and its inmates are furnished in advance with a
verdict here prepared for their use&mdash;&quot;justifiable homicide
in self-defense&quot;! Away with such morality! encouraging
a juror to violate his oath, by disregarding the Law, which
he has just sworn to his country and to his God, shall govern
his verdict! and encouraging a fugitive to expect him
to do so!&mdash;We may yet see whether the jurymen of our
country will regard their oath, or will follow the religious
counsel of this religious paper.</p>

<p>I am not justifying slavery. I am pleading obedience to
the texts before me. Slavery may be wrong. Be it so;
there is still a <i>righteous</i> method to get rid of it. But if
slavery <i>is</i> wrong, that does not make violence and murder
<i>right</i>.</p>

<p>I am not justifying the fugitive-slave Law. It may be
wrong: it may be unwise and unconstitutional. I think
that any wise and modest man would hesitate much to pronounce
it unconstitutional, after its enactment by a body of
men who <i>aimed</i> to abide by the constitution, and who
studied the matter most intensely, with every opportunity
for information and with minds trained for years in the
depths of legal science. But, be it wrong&mdash;be it unwise
and unconstitutional; there are civil courts to decide upon
its constitutionality, and no man has <i>any right</i> to decide for
<i>himself</i> that it is unconstitutional, and act upon that decision:
if he had such a right, then every man would be his
own Lawmaker, and public Constitution and Law would be
nothing but a bugbear or a bubble! Be it wrong; there is
a peaceful, prescribed way of amending both Law and
Constitution,&mdash;and a wrong in the Law does not make false-swearing
by the juryman and murder by the fugitive
<i>right</i>!</p>

<p>It is a most marvellous thing, what a number of clergymen
north of Mason and Dixon's line, have, all of a sudden,
become such great <i>Constitutional lawyers</i>! Never before
was anything like it! It is a modern miracle! A decision
upon a great constitutional question is nothing to them!
How amazingly these profound legalists, these clergyman
jurists, would adorn the high courts of the country if they
would only consent to take their seat upon the bench! The
Judges of the United States Supreme Court ought to be
thankful, that these clergymen Judges have done their duty
for them in advance, deciding the law to be unconstitutional
and no more is to be done! Benevolent men, these clergymen!
Some have done the duty of the jurors for them and
others the duty of the judges&mdash;the verdict and the decision
are both recorded! yea indeed, in advance, and without
pay!</p>

<p>But seriously, it were far better, that these clergymen
should attend to their own appropriate duties to which
their Master has bidden them, than to be engaged in fostering
excitements among their people, which <i>never can</i> result
in any good, civil or religious. If we shall have the rebellion,
disunion, and civil war, to which these evil principles
and these excitements tend, the guilt of such clergymen
will not be small! I would not have their accountability
for all the gold of Ophir!</p>

<p>But it is not all the clergymen of this part of the country,
nor the most of them, nor the half of them, who have
turned Constitutional lawyers, or turned law opposers. I
hesitate not to say, it is only a small minority, and those in
general who are not entitled to the most respect for erudition,
sense, or excellence of character. The (New School)
Synod of New York and New Jersey, as respectable a body
of ministers and elders as is to be found in the Presbyterian
Church, at their late meeting in this city, had good sense
enough, and good religion enough, to &quot;leave the constitutionality
of the recent enactment&quot; (the Fugitive Slave Law)
&quot;to be adjudicated by the civil tribunals of the country.&quot;
They deserve the thanks of the country and of all mankind.
The solid sense and real religion of the land will respect
their decision.</p>

<p>I have nothing to do with politics or party. I am only
insisting upon religious obedience to Law. I am preaching
the texts before me. Such obedience is a religious duty.
It is the will of God. I appeal to the texts. They proclaim
the Law of God. Peaceful subjection to government <i>is</i> his
law; and men are guilty of sophistry and falsehood, when,
to excuse wicked evasion of Law or violent resistance, they
pretend to appeal to what they call &quot;the higher laws of
God.&quot; <i>There are no such higher laws.</i> The texts before
me are his law. If one man has a moral right, either cunningly
to evade or openly to violate Law, under such pleading,
then another man has the same right to violate <i>another</i>
Law; and thus any villainy on earth may be perpetrated under
the sacred names of &quot;conscience,&quot; and &quot;the higher laws
of God!&quot; Nothing is <i>safe</i> in the hands of men of such
principles. These principles undermine the foundations <i>of
all society among men</i>! As I told you last Wednesday
evening in my lecture, the question before the country is <i>not</i>,
(as the deceivers pretend,) whether God's laws are not higher
than man's, or whether God's laws are to be obeyed. Nobody
disputes either of these things. Nobody ever did.
But the question is, whether it is the will of God that men
should submit to the laws of the land, or aim to paralyze
law, cheat it, cripple it, resist it, and thus overthrow the
government of the country&mdash;a government at this moment
more beneficial than any other that ever existed.</p>

<p>Nor is it true, that the fugitive slave is made an &quot;outlaw,&quot;
and on <i>that</i> ground justifiable for bloody and murderous
resistance of Law. He is under the protection of Law; and
if any man injures him or kills him, the Law will avenge
him, just as soon as it would you or me. He is <i>not</i> made
an outlaw: common sense knows better.</p>

<p>The matter before us is a very serious matter. The
wicked principles of which I have spoken, disguise it as you
will, tend directly to anarchy, confusion, and civil war!
The question <i>is not</i>, whether slavery is right, or the Fugitive
Slave Law right. It draws deeper. The question is, shall
Law be put in force, and the government of the country
stand; or shall Law be resisted, and the government of the
country disobeyed, and the nation plunged into all the horrors
of civil war? If Law cannot be executed, it is time to
write the epitaph of your country!</p>

<p>Suffer me to utter a few words of earnest counsel to you,
my beloved people.</p>

<p> 1. Beware of the influence of <i>mere feeling</i> on this serious
subject. Your feelings may be with the slave,&mdash;so are mine,
so are those of most of the Southern people. We all want
men to be free; and <i>no more</i> do we want it now, than did
the inhabitants of this country before we were born: the
extravagant fanaticism and noisy zeal of the Northern abolitionists
have not increased the sentiment of the country in
favour of freedom a single item. But what can we <i>do</i>?
This is a very grave and difficult subject. One thing is
certain,&mdash;the perpetual abuse of our Southern brethren, violence,
disunion, and bloody murder will do us no good,&mdash;whether
we are bondmen or freemen. And when we think
on this subject, let us aim to be cool, unimpassioned, deliberate,
and give reason and religion their just influence over
us.</p>

<p> 2. Beware of prejudice. Do not make up your mind
hastily, and under the impulses of mere feeling, without
any just and extensive information. Study the matter
calmly, extensively, and on all sides and aspects of it.</p>

<p> 3. Study it <i>religiously</i>. Keep it, in your mind, aloof from
all the excitements and influences of party and party spirit.
Let me say to you, my beloved people, study it on your
knees, in earnest prayer to God. Learn your duty from
God's word, praying in the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p> 4. Aim to cultivate the entire spirit of your Lord and
Master, Jesus Christ. Feel as he felt. Act as he acted.
Pray as he prayed. Seek the <i>salvation</i> of sinners, as he
sought it,&mdash;evidently putting more value upon <i>that</i> for every
dying son of Adam, than upon all things earthly. Oh remember,
you <i>will be the best citizens, just when you are the
best Christians</i>;&mdash;and I do believe in my heart, you will do
most earthly good to your fellow-men, just when you do
them most spiritual good,&mdash;leading them, by example, by
precept, and prayer, to &quot;seek <i>first</i> the kingdom of God.&quot;</p>

<p> 5. Be obedient to the laws of your land. Do not resist
these <i>ordinances of God</i>. Stand by the Constitution of your
country. If that die, <i>the most</i> of your happiness and your
hopes die with it!&mdash;yea, it would be a calamity to the civilized
world! Christianity herself would be hindered a whole
century in her march! Respect your rulers. Frown indignantly
upon the low and vile abuse now heaped so liberally
upon the great men of your country. Be peaceful Citizens.
Be a <i>law-abiding people</i>, with all your sentiments opposed
to violence, bloodshed, and confusion; and aim to allay all
the excited and angry feelings that may come up around
you.</p>

<p>Finally; have your hope and your trust in God. Men
women, and children, I beseech every one of you to beware
of the spirit of worldliness, and the excitements of worldly
subjects and interests; and let not such interests and subjects
prevent your conversion to Christ, your holiness and
eternal salvation. Pray for yourselves, your children, your
rulers; and let your prayerful and humble trust in God hold
you safe, amid all the agitations of a world that you must
soon leave for another. God grant it to you, through Jesus
Christ our Saviour. Amen.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
